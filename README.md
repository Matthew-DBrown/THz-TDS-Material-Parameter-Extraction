# THz-TDS-Material-Parameter-Extraction

This is an ongoing project looking at extracting material parameters such as complex refractive index and complex permittivity of samples at THz frequencies.
The aim will be applying this to High-Resistivity Float-Zone Silicon (HRFZ-Si) and modelling Whispering Gallery Mode Resonators (WGMRs) with the material parameters extracted from this algorithm.
